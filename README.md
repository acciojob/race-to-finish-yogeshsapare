# Race to the Finish

Create an array of five promises, each of which resolves with a random time between 1 and 5 seconds. Use Promise.any to wait for the first promise to resolve, and then print its result to the div of id `output`.

## Instructions

1. Add your promises to the array `promises` that is already declared in the `script.js` file. No need to change that line.
2. Using `Promise.any()` print the result in the output div.
